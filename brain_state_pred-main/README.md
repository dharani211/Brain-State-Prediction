# Predicting Human Brain States with Transformer
The human brain is a complex and highly dynamic system, and our current knowledge of its functional mechanism is still very limited. Fortunately, with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we can observe blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) changes, reflecting neural activity, to infer brain states and dynamics. In this paper, we ask the question of whether the brain states rep-resented by the regional brain fMRI can be predicted. Due to the success of self-attention and the transformer architecture in sequential auto-regression problems (e.g., language modelling or music generation), we explore the possibility of the use of transformers to predict human brain resting states based on the large-scale high-quality fMRI data from the human connectome project (HCP). Current re-sults have shown that our model can accurately predict the brain states up to 5.04s with the previous 21.6s. Furthermore, even though the prediction error ac-cumulates for the prediction of a longer time period, the generated fMRI brain states reflect the architecture of  functional connectome. These promising initial results demonstrate the possibility of developing generative models for fMRI data using self-attention that learns the functional organization of the human brain.
